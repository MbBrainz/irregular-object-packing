# Profiling

Ideas for profiling:

profile only single steps but using different initialisation states.
different sampling factors. -> predict how this will influence the performance on large scale
different stages. -> See if SciPy optimizer is slower at stages that are less packed yet
different number of objects. -> See if SciPy optimizer is slower at stages that are less packed yet
change numbers and sampling factors. -> We can compare wether adding more points is more influential than adding more objects.

memory profiling

time profiling

can we set this up in a way that we can run it in one go and then just get the results?
