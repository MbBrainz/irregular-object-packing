UPDATE: Clipped Voronoi Diagram Packing is something that might be useful for later, but its only relevant for the initialisation phase and not for the actual packing.
        Also, the algo might need adjustment to conform  Centroidal power diagram method to suffice for our algorithm.

This module contains the implementation of the clipped voronoi diagram packing algorithm.

The algorithm is based on the following papers:
